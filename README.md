# Metronode Command Utility

We built this cli to help generate node apps using the app standard we find to greatly improve our productivity. The project is based on typescript and nodejs environments.

## Usage

```bash

metronode new --project-name <<projectname>> --destination <<destinantion>>

```

### Validation

Your project name must meet the following standard

1. Use letters
2. Not contain random symbols (but it can include an underscore)
3. Not start with a number (but it can include numbers)

#### Sample Project Names

```js
test_project;
projectToday;
project;
```
